# 42-Cub3D

## Introduction
Cub3d is a graphical project from 42 School that involves creating a simple 3D game engine using raycasting. It is inspired by early 90s games like Wolfenstein 3D and aims to render a first-person 3D view based on a 2D map. The project covers several topics such as graphics rendering, handling input, and managing game mechanics like player movement and collision detection. It is designed to give students experience with low-level graphics programming and event-driven game loops.

My goal for this project was to create a game inspired by the world of **The Walking Dead**. For this purpose, the textures of the wall are a bit gory as for the zombies. You can also kill the zombies with a knife and I advise you to wear earphones if you don't want everybody around you to ear the opening song of **The Walking Dead**.
